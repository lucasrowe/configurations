Configurations
==============

Configuration files for all my workstations including IDE settings.

Whenever using one of these configs just create a symbolic link to the appropriate
configuration file in this repo. I'll do my best to document whenver I add
a new file what I use it for.

## Creating Symbolic Link
In case this is new to you, this is how you create a symbolic link.

    ln -s PATH_TO_CONFIGURATION_FILE LOCATION_OF_NEEDED_CONFIG

So for example, to link your home profile to this repo's profile, you'd run this:

    cd
    ln -s ~/projects/configurations/.profile ~/.profile

## List of Configs

**.profile** Mac configs including colorizing and git setup

**.bashrc** Ubuntu configs including colorizing and other nicities copied from other places
